    <h2>Gabriel Graphs</h2>
<p>
Given a point set $P$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we define an edge 
$(p_i,p_j)$ of two points, $p_i,p_j \in P$ to belong to the Gabriel Graph of $P$,
$GG(P)$
if the smallest radius $d(p_i,p_j)/2$ ball containing $p_i,p_j$ contains no 
other points in its interior or boundary, where $d(p_{i}, p_{j})$ 
denotes the Euclidean distance between the two points. 
</p>
<p>
We define the $k$-Gabriel graph of $P$, $k-GG(P)$ similarly, 
admitting an edge $e = (p_i,p_j)$
to the graph if the smallest radius $d(p_i,p_j)/2$ ball containing $p_i,p_j$
contains $k-1$ many other points in its interior or boundary.
$GG(P)$ is thus equivalent to $1-GG(P)$.
</p>
<h3>Brute-Force Construction</h3>
<p>
A straightforward, brute-force solution to construct $k-GG(P)$ , is to consider all 
$O(n^{2})$ many possible edges, and check, using the \texttt{inCircle} predicate
whether the $n-2$ other points are outside of the circle. As the \texttt{inCircle}
predicate costs $O(d)$, in dimension $d$, for large dimensions, this method results
in an $O(dn^{3})$ algorithm, which is an inefficient but reliable way to construct
$k-GG(P)$.
</p>

<h2>Relative Neighbourhood Graphs</h2>
<p>
A subgraph of the Gabriel Graph that is of considerable interest is the Relative Neighbourhood
Graph, of RNG of a point set. More generally, consider a point set $P = \{p_1,...,p_n\}$ 
where each $p_i \in R^{d}$. We admit an edge $e = (p_i, p_j)$ to the graph if 
$$d(p_i,p_j) \leq \max_{k \neq i,j, k \in P}(d(p_i,p_k), d(p_j,p_k))$$
where $d(p_i,p_j)$ computes the distance on the $L_2$ metric.
</p>
<p>
Originally introduced by Toussaint, he motivates the problem by providing some potential
applications, such as use in clustering - where two points should have an edge between 
each other if it's likely that they belong to the same cluster. In other words, the
existence of an edge
between two points should indicate some degree of 'similarity'. Another algorithm could then 
use the RNG, or other `proximity graph' to only consider a small subset of all possible edges, which 
in the case of the Gabriel Graph or RNG is linear in the number of vertices. 
</p>
<p>
The relative neighbourhood graph is of particular interest due to it's potential for instance 
based learning algorithms in Machine Learning. In particular, the RNG is important when trying
to reduce the size of a training set. For example, the RNG can be used to reduce the size of the 
training set, while still avoiding misclassification. Emperical studies
have shown that graphs such as the Gabriel Graph tend to become complete once the 
dimensionality of our data set grows large, suggesting  sparser graphs such as the Relative 
Neighbourhood Graph and the Minimum Spanning Tree may perform better on  higher dimensional data sets.
